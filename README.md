Unveiling Insights: Comprehensive Sales Analysis Project for CyberTech Sales Data

This dataset that I found online has spans from January to July 2019. I sought to understand the mystery of this sales data based on performance by two distinct store that will be useful for decision making and to improve their bottom line.
My goal for this dataset was to analyze and identify trends, uncover opportunities for growth and optimize their sales strategy.

# Data Cleaning

Using the Microsof Excel, I was able to process and visualize the data efficiently. I started by cleaning the data, converting the serial date number to standard US locale date format and then transforming it into a table.

# Analysis Technique

I employed descriptive analytics to summarize historical sales data and sum the number of sales by each store and Manager. I use the "TEXT" Function to extract Month from the date column for trends over month analysis.
I also leverage the use of "SUMIFS" and "IFS" Function to summarize sales data by store and manager.‚Äù

# Visualization 
I created and designed an Interactive Dashboard without using a common slicer. I leverage the use of advance button to give it more interactive and to challenge myself with uncommon practice. The dasboard was compose of different type of chart visualization such as key metrics of the total sales, most purchase item, top performing manager, the comparison of MicroWorld vs Computech, and the partition between category items based on profitability.

# Key Findings

1. Trends and Patterns:
  My analysis revealed that Microworld outperformed Computech with over $1 million in total sales.
  I discovered as well that Dev Singh, a manager at Computech, had the lowest sales, with no sales recorded from January to June.
  The amount of sales from Mobile Phones from computech is higher among the rest which indicate that this is the most product category that is highly profitable.
  Both stores experienced a steady sales trend until a significant drop in July.

3. Insights: 
  Memory Cards at Microworld had the highest sales, totaling $10,675,940. Mobile Phones were the most profitable category at Computech, with sales of $9,494,115.

4. Recommendations:
  I recommend investing more in marketing strategy and enhancing the online shopping experience to capitalize on the growing trend of the two products I mentioned. It is also worth checking the lowest performer manager in Computech to investigate the low total of sales.

# Conclusion 

Through this comprehensive sales analysis, CyberTech gained valuable insights into their sales performance, leading to more informed strategic decisions.
